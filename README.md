# Java Cloud Debugger

The Cloud Debugger lets you inspect the state of a Java application at any code
location without stopping or slowing it down. The debugger makes it easier to
view the application state without adding logging statements.

You can use the Cloud Debugger on both production and staging instances of your
application. The debugger adds less than 10ms to the request latency only when
the application state is captured. In most cases, this is not noticeable by
users.

For information on how to use the Cloud Debugger please see
[Cloud Debugger](https://cloud.google.com/tools/cloud-debugger/).

Google provides a binary distribution for Java Cloud Debugger that you can
use. This open package lets you build it from source code instead.
