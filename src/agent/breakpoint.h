// states:
//   1. Uninitialized: this is the state the breakpoint gets right after the
//      object is constructed.
//   2. Pending: we know that the breakpoint is valid, but we still don't know
//      the Java jmethodID and jlocation and the JVMTI breakpoint is not set.
//      A breakpoint will remain pending until the class containing the source
//      location is loaded by JVM (JVM loads classes when they are referenced).
//   3. Active: the {jmethodID, jlocation} tuple has been resolved and JVMTI
//      breakpoint is set.
//
// JvmBreakpoint might get deactivated or completed on one thread while another
// thread is processing a breakpoint hit. The implementation is using
// shared_ptr to snapshot the state. Locks must not be used in callbacks that
// may invoke Java method (through JNI). This is because Java methods may
// inadvertently trigger other synchronous callbacks causing application
// deadlock.
//
// "Breakpoint" will start receiving "OnClassPrepared" event right after the
// object is constructed (even in uninitialized state).
//
// Each active breakpoint is associated with a single code location. Unlike in
// C++ generics in Java don't duplicate compiled code.
