// Immutable state of a compiled breakpoint.

// "CompiledBreakpoint" keeps a global reference to the Java class containing
// the location where the breakpoint is set. This ensures that JVM will not
// unload the method with the breakpoint. Unloading a method with breakpoint
// presents us with a number of challenges:
// * We need to listen for notification about the method getting loaded back
//   to re-enable breakpoint.
// * There is a possibility of various race conditions when a method is being
//   unloaded and a breakpoint is being set. Protecting against all those
//   is not trivial task.
// * There is no easy way to trigger compiled method unload in integration test.
