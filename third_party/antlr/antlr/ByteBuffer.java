/**A Stream of characters fed to the lexer from a InputStream that can
 * be rewound via mark()/rewind() methods.
 * <p>
 * A dynamic array is used to buffer up all the input characters.  Normally,
 * "k" characters are stored in the buffer.  More characters may be stored during
 * guess mode (testing syntactic predicate), or when LT(i>k) is referenced.
 * Consumption of characters is deferred.  In other words, reading the next
 * character is not done by conume(), but deferred until needed by LA or LT.
